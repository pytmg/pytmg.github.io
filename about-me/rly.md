# About TMG

**I code.**

I code in Python, JS, TS, and Iâ€™m picking up C# to get into .NET and game dev with Unity. Been at it for 3 years with Python, 1 year with JS, and 4 or so months with TS.

## My Projects

Check out my projects below! Currently, the project that I'm working on the most is my **CLI Framework**, y'know, with pushing out new updates and all, been at it for.. I wanna say a month now, on the framework. It's made entirely in Python and I do plan on making a version in C# and MAYBE JavaScript. <small>probably not</small>

This did come from my old account (GDTMG232), which I've lost access to, unfortunately, BUT, can for sure say that I've been working on this account for long enough to the point where it's not that big a deal, so that's all good <img src="thumbsup.png" class="moji">. I don't need that account for much, plus if I end up needing to update YouTube Downloader or KeyboardSounds at all, I can just fork or contribute to them.
